  Huat (ç™¼): prosperity, to prosper
</div>

Gambling is a huge part of Chinese culture, particularly in Singapore where the term "huat" is commonly used in a gambling context to hope for good luck. TOTO is Singapore's legalised lottery, operated by Singapore Pools.

TOTO rules / payouts:

https://online.singaporepools.com/en/lottery/toto-prize-structure

Currently, when one buys TOTO, there is no easy way to check the winnings. One way is to check manually, but that becomes very time consuming and labourious. Singapore Pools offers a prize calculator on their website <a href="https://www.singaporepools.com.sg/en/product/Pages/toto_results.aspx">here</a> but that is also not that much better and still fairly manual. There is a need to select the draw date and tick the numbers one by one, and only one bet can be checked at a time. 

Furthermore, there is no way to keep track of one's winnings across so many physical tickets that will likely be discarded. 

Enter _**Turn Down for Huat**_. This app simplifies results checking through the use of optical character recognition, where users can upload images of their tickets, see the results immediately, and store their tickets for easy future reference.
